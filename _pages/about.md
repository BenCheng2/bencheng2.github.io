üë®‚Äçüéì I‚Äôm a third year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto and am currently interning in Ericsson developing 5G ML application. 

üíï My research interests are in Machine Learning, High Performance Computing and Infrastructure Design.
ü§ñ I‚Äôm currently working as a research assistant at the Vector Institute / UHN and participating in a medical time-series machine learning project supervised by Professor Michael Brudno and Professor Rahul Krishnan. I've also participated in Energy System + Graph Theory research with Professor Yize Chen and crafted a publication studying Alberta Power Distribution.

Personal Experience
======

## Ericsson 5G ML Development
--Implemented Deep Q-Network (DQN) to 5G SRS Scheduling and RL Algorithm to 5G Antenna Calibration,
catering to network providers including Bell and CMCC
--Collaborated on the implementation of Embedded Real-time Communication C++ Application, establishing
synchronization between Inference Model, RL Training Server and InfluxDB Time-Series Database
--Participated in the research, implementation and Field Test Time-Series analysis of AiXellerator application,
leading to 20% boost in real-time downlink throughput and 10% boost in spectral efficiency 

## Energy System + Graph Theory Research
--Investigated and implemented a carbon emission tracing algorithm on Alberta‚Äôs electricity network, aiming to
visualize and analyze provincial-level or national-level carbon emission distribution
--Utilized the Power Dispatch Model with BFS and LP algorithms to formulate, derive, and evaluate the contribution
of individual generators and visualize the power distribution and consumption distribution
--Supervised by Professor Yize Chen at the University of Alberta

## Time-Series Machine Learning Research
--Investigated the influence of Recurrent and Feedforward Neural Networks in predicting Tacrolimus Dose
Requirement for liver-transplant patients, aiming to optimize the clinical medicine dose selection
--Conducted neural network application experiments on liver-transplant datasets from University Health Network
--Supervised by Processor Michael Brudno and Professor Rahul Krishnan at the Vector Institute

## Wifi-Positioning + LLM Research
--Developed a spatial-aware cartography application supporting indoor position estimation, relative rooms position
reasoning and auto-decision during measurement and training process
--Researched the potential of utilizing CSP algorithm for relative relationship deduction and LLM for description
organization and decision making
--Supervised by Professor Khai Truong at the Dynamic Graphics Project lab

## Centre for Social Services Engineering Full Stack Development
--Implemented a responsive search engine with GraphDB and React, featuring multi-condition filtering and
pagination, and constructed a Material-designed user interface constructed by React and TypeScript
--Optimized and streamlined SPARQL queries with Lucene integration, enhancing system efficiency and reducing
search time by more than 60%, with improved system robustness and scalability
--Collaborated on a full-stack project, connecting Ontotext Graph Database with NodeJS backend codebase,
constructed efficient data pipelines for information sharing, with comprehensive test coverage using Jest library

## Middleware Systems Research Group Software Development
--Designed and developed a modern web application using Django CMS and Nginx, featuring a custom-built search
engine crafted with scikit-learn
--Implemented a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automating code integration, Docker container deployment on
the testing server, and the periodic management of secure HTTP certificates
--Integrated the Google Scholar API with MySQL and Redis databases to update and manage the publication
information of research projects and collaborators

## ActEarn Startup Software Engineer
--Contributed to the development of an AI-integrated social application designed to foster lasting connections
between students and alumni, utilizing GAN and LLM model to enhance user engagement and network growth
--Leveraged React Native to develop a responsive mobile chat interface, integrating backend services with SendBird
for real-time messaging and Clerk for user authentication, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency
