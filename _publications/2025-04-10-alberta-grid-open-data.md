We propose an optimization-based approach to recover power grid topology and line flow directions using open datasets from the Alberta power system. Our method enables mapping of multi-modal system data to a geographical topology, and introduces a novel visualization and analysis framework for grid modeling, carbon tracking, and synthetic data generation.
